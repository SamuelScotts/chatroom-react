# chatroom-react
A practice chatroom app built using JavaScript, the React library and Firebase.  Built as part of chapter/tutorial from my Masters course.  Worked through a tutorial to build the application, and made little amenedments to the codes structure based upon how I work.  A still ongoing project, as the chapter/tutorial is not yet complete.  Still to add at least the ability to upload images.

While working on the project, initially ran a scrum style agile working board for practice doing same.  See below for images demonstrating the current state of the application.

To start the app:

```
cd chatroom
npm start
```

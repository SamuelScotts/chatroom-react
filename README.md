# chatroom-react
A practice chatroom app built using JavaScript, the React library and Firebase.  Built as part of chapter five from my Masters course.  Lead through a tutorial to build the application, with a little amenedments based upon how I work here and there.  Still ongoing.  Intention to add ability to upload images.

Ran a scrum style agile working board while building this project for practice doing same.  See below for images demonstrating the current state of the application.

To start the app:

```
cd chatroom
npm start
```

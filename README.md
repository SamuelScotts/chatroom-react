# chatroom-react
A practice chatroom app built using JavaScript, the React library and Firebase.  Built as part of an excellent chapter/tutorial from the Masters course I'm studying.  Slight changes to the tutorial's code structure based upon how I work.  A still ongoing project, as I've not finished working through the chapter.  

Tasks outstanding:

[ ] - Add ability to upload images.

While working on the project, initially ran a scrum style agile working board for practice doing same.  See below for images demonstrating the current state of the application.

To start the app:

```
cd chatroom
npm start
```
